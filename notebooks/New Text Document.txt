# Business Understanding
## 1 Determining Business Objectives
### 1.1 Finding Business Objectives
As the amount of ships is increasing in the world and someone will dare to build the biggest cruising ship, I am going to create a predication model which will predict based on some details wheater you will make it if the ships crushes into something big in the waste sea

Objectives:
Predict if a passenger will make it on the next ship crash in atlantic
Identifying meaningful patterns in features will help improve model’s accuracy

#### Determine Organizational Structure
This project was picked from the course instructor's choices. It is conducted as part of an individual assignment and is evaluated according to the rubrics  of the course. 

Student - I am going to be evaluated by the Course instructor based on rubrics
Course Instructor - Evaluates the student based on the rubrics

The project are used for educational purposes. They demonstrate my ability to apply the CRISP-DM methodology and basic data science techniques

The problem area of this project is data analysis and predictive modeling. The focus is  using historical passenger data to understand and predict survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster.

#### Describe Problem Area
My aim is to use historical passenger data to predict survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster. 

I am going to look into the details of passenger like age, sex, if they had siblings or spouses, number of parents and children abroad, where they boarded the ship which class they bought or if they survived and predict if the passenger would survive the sinking ship. 

The project assumes that I have basic knowledge of Python and common data analysis tools. It also assumes that I am familiar with basic machine learning concepts that were introduced during the course.

The data mining project is appointed to me as part of the course requirements. The scope, constraints, and evaluation criteria are defined by assignment description.

#### Describe Current Solution
Currently, there is no existing solution for this project. This is the start of the work, so I first set up the project structure using a cookiecutter-style template and created a conda environment for the project.

### 1.2 Defining Business Objectives
The problem in this project is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using available passenger data.

The business goal would be very wierd, but its to predict if you would survive sinking ship Titanic.

The other requirements would be to follow rubrics; 
I must follow the CRISP-DM process and structure my notebook using the CRISP-DM phases
I must document my work clearly so the instructor can follow what I did and why
I must show decision-making
The project should be reproducible
I must clearly describe the problem context and what I am trying to solve
I must implement the full workflow up to modeling and evaluation
I must validate results
I must use plots/tables to support conclusions
The analysis should be correct and consistent with the chosen goal
The conclusions should be supported by evidence from the data

The benefits of this project would be to predict based on data if I would survive the Titanic

### 1.3 Business Success Criteria
The business success criteria are straight forward; The final model can predict with 75% probability that if you survived or not the Titanic ride. 
Key survival factors will be identified.The evidence is supported by analysis and visualizations
The project is reproducible.

Subjective criteria
The results and conclusions are easy to understand and clearly explained
The workflow follows CRISP-DM properly and is well documented. 

## 2 Assessing the Situation
Data
The data available for this project is a single structured dataset in CSV format named titanic1.csv. Each row represents one passenger. The dataset is labeled, which makes it suitable for supervised machine learning, especially a binary classification task survived vs. not survived.

The dataset contains the following main columns:
Passengerid: unique passenger ID
Age: passenger age number
Fare: ticket price number
Sex: encoded as 0 or 1
sibsp: number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: number of parents/children aboard
Pclass: passenger class (1, 2, 3)
Embarked: encoded embarkation port
2urvived: target variable 0 or 1
zero / zero.*: columns filled with 0 values

Some variables are already encoded  Sex, Embarked, so their meaning needs to be verified during Data Understanding. The dataset also includes multiple “zero” columns, which will be checked and removed during Data Preparation if they contain no useful information

Personnel
The project is carried out by one student. Basic Python and machine learning knowledge is assumed from the course, and guidance is available through course materials and the instructor.

Risks
The main risks are missing or inconsistent which will need to be verified, non-informative columns like the zero columns, and overfitting due to the dataset size. There is also a risk of misunderstanding encoded variables if there is no clear explain behind it 

Contingency plan
To handle these risks, the dataset will be checked for missing values and consistency, non-informative columns will be removed after verification.

### 2.1 Resource Inventory
This project is executed on a personal computer. Its basic machine learning, no specific one needed.
 
The primary data source for this project is a single CSV file titanic1.csv. provided as part of the course assignment. The data is stored locally and accessed directly through the Python environment. No security issues 

Support and guidance are available through course materials and the course instructor. No additional support staff are required.


### 2.2 Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints

#### Determine Requirements
The main requirement of this project is to achieve the business objective defined earlier, which is to  predict passenger survival using the Titanic dataset while following the CRISP-DM methodology.

There are no legal or security restrictions. The projects timeline is this: 
Weeks 3.1–3.3 work on
Business Understanding: Define assignment, read related works, deep dive into the assignment’s domain.
Data Understanding: Explore and analyse the dataset.
Data Preparation: Clean, pre-process, and transform the dataset to prepare it for modelling.

Weeks 3.3–3.5 work on
Modelling: Select, train, and refine machine learning model/s suitable for the problem.
Evaluation: Assess the model(s) with correct performance metrics and discuss the results.

End of week 3.5 submit
Hand-in summative deliverable! That is a documented Jupyter notebook.

The results only need to be presented in a Jupyter Notebook for academic assessment.

#### Clarify Assumptions
There are no economic factors. At the end the instructor expects not only the final results but also a clear explanation of how the results were obtained, including data preparation and modeling steps. Everything should be noted down and properly explained. 

Data assumption
The survival label is correct
2urvived correctly indicates whether the passenger survived (0/1).

The important columns represent what they claim
Age is age in years, Fare is ticket price, Pclass is class

Missing values are not completely random, but are manageable
Some fields may be missing 
Passengerid 62 - embarked field missing
Passengerid 830- embarked field missing

The “zero” columns are non-informative placeholders
I assume columns full of zeros do not contain useful signal and can be removed after verification.

I assume the dataset is mostly correct and complete enough to perform analysis. I also assume the survival label is reliable, and that missing values and non-informative columns can be handled during data preparation.

#### Verify Constraints
No passwords are required for this project, the dataset is publicly available and provided for educational purposes as part of the course and this project does not involve any financial costs.


### 2.3 Risks and Contingencies
Scheduling: The projects take 5 weeks.At the end of the week 5 it is necessary to submit the related documents mentioned before.
Financial: No financial risks
Data: The data should not be poor quality. It was made for educational purpose by the professors. 
Results: If the result is not sufficient for the professor will mark fail for the class


Contingency plan: 
Scheduling/Results: I fail the school, or retake this in the next few weeks
Data: If the data is corrupted, insufficient or problematic, there is 4 other datasets to chose from. 


### 2.4 Terminology
Survived (2urvived)
Binary target variable indicating whether a passenger survived 1 or did not survive 0.

Binary classification
A machine learning task where the outcome has two possible values 1 or 2.

Missing values
Data entries that are not present in the dataset and must be handled during data preparation.

Encoding
The process of converting categorical variables into numerical form, so they can be used by machine learning models.

CRISP-DM
A standard data mining methodology used to structure the project from business understanding to evaluation.

### 2.5 Cost/Benefit Analysis
There are no costs. The benefit of better data understanding is to have better knowledge of statics if a ship crashes and who will survive.
