    "## Collecting Initial Data\n",
    "This project uses a single existing data source provided with the course assignment: titanic1.csv. The dataset contains 1,309 passenger records, where each row represents one passenger and includes demographic and travel-related attributes like Age, Sex, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Pclass, Embarked and the binary target variable 2urvived (survived vs. not survived).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial inspection shows two missing values in Embarked (Passengerid 62 and 830). These missing values will be handled during the data preparation phase using a documented strategy but the initial solution would be to input the most frequent category to missing fields in Embarked. The dataset also contains several columns named zero, that are constant (all zeros) and therefore provide no predictive value. These will be removed during preprocessing.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Passengerid** — *Integer (ID)*; unique passenger identifier\n",
    "- **Age** — *Numeric (float)*; passenger age in years.\n",
    "- **Fare** — *Numeric (float)*; ticket price.\n",
    "- **Sex** — *Categorical (binary)*; passenger sex (encoding described in preprocessing).\n",
    "- **SibSp** — *Numeric (integer)*; number of siblings/spouses aboard.\n",
    "- **Parch** — *Numeric (integer)*; number of parents/children aboard.\n",
    "- **Pclass** — *Categorical (integer)*; passenger class 1, 2, 3\n",
    "- **Embarked** — *Categorical (integer)*; port of embarkation 1, 2, 3\n",

    "* At this stage, attributes can be  prioritized based on historical context and domain knowledge. **Sex and Age** are expected to be highly influential due to the evacuation policy often summarized as “women and children first.” \n",
    "* Additionally, **Pclass and Fare** are expected to be relevant, as passenger class reflects socio-economic status, which likely affected access to lifeboats and crew assistance. \n",
    "* Variables related to family structure (**SibSp, Parch**) may also be influential, since travelling with close family especially children could affect evacuation priority and decision-making during the disaster. Identifier and constant variables like **Passengerid**, **zero*** columns are not considered relevant for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, relevant attributes can be preliminarily prioritized based on knowledge of the Titanic disaster history.\n",
    "**Sex, Pclass, Age, and Fare** are expected to be the most influential, as historical evidence suggests strong survival differences across gender, socio-economic class, and age groups.\n",
